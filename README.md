# Public-products

This repository contains a few public files summarizing forecasted instrument performances. 

- *Point_Source_Sensitivity_v28_base_cbe.txt* contains the point source sensitivity (AB magnitude, 5 sigma) over the full sky and deep fields, assumed to be two 100 sq. deg. field at the north and south ecliptic poles.
- *Surface_Brightness_v28_base_cbe.txt* contains the surface  brightness noise level (nW/m^2/sr per pixel, 1 sigma) over the full sky and deep fields, assumed to be two 100 sq. deg. field at the north and south ecliptic poles.
- *galaxy_density_v28_base_cbe.txt* contains SPHEREx forecasted number density and bias for fives samples for multiple redshift bins. Each line corresponds to a subsample defined by redshift uncertainty, respectively sigma(z)/(1+z) = 0 - 0.003, 0.003 - 0.01, 0.01 - 0.03, 0.03 - 0.1, 0.1 - 0.2.
- *FWHM_v28_base_cbe.txt* contains the effective FWHM (optical PSF plus pointing jitter) as a function of wavelength.
