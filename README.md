# Public-products

This repository contains a few public files summarizing forecasted instrument performances.

- *Point_Source_Sensitivity_v28_base_cbe.txt* contains the point source sensitivity (AB magnitude, 5 sigma) over the full sky and deep fields, assumed to be two 100 sq. deg. field at the north and south ecliptic poles.
- *Surface_Brightness_v28_base_cbe.txt* contains the surface  brightness noise level (nW/m^2/sr per pixel, 1 sigma) over the full sky and deep fields, assumed to be two 100 sq. deg. field at the north and south ecliptic poles.
